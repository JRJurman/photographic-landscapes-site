To design for a client can be stressful, though to design for yourself can be exhausting.
A poster should tell a story; direct clarity is optional. Promotional concert posters
still require a message which even the yet to be fan can somehow interpret. It is
mandatory for a graphic designer to aim beyond simply re-writing the message
displayed, and present the client with something fresh and engaging.
