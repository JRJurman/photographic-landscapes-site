This is the only college project featured within my portfolio. As a final project
within my Information Design course, students were asked to compose numerous
panels displaying change over time. I knew change over time could be represented
 through one panel alone, if the right tools were utilized. Using transparency
 pages, I displayed four pages (one for each month of changing data) which can
 then be removed or added. Creating an involved relationship with the viewer (I
 feel) is one of the best ways to get the message across.
