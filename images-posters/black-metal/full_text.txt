"Black Metal" (as it came to be known) is an extreme style of heavy metal, which
came to its peak in 1993. I aimed to represent the power and shock-value many bands
of the time displayed, through bringing two elements together; fire (or the
many disturbing cases of arson), and the controversial religious views coming
from bands of the genre.
