  Welcome to Photographic Landscapes in Rochester, New York.  
  Here you will find a series of impressionistic looking photographs 
  that I created through the use of in-camera multiple exposure,
  an experimental technique that creates a soft focus, impressionistic 
  quality photograph.

<p>
  My unique style of photography will enhance any wall space
  where beautiful scenic artwork is needed. My work has been installed in 
  corporate offices, hotels, dental and law offices, hospitals, medical centers 
  and homes throughout the country.

<p>
  All photographs can be custom printed on a variety of paper types,
  (even canvas) and can be matted and framed to fit your decor.
</p>

<p>
  Framed pieces are mounted, matted, signed, and have reflection control
  (non glare) glass.  Only acid free materials are used in the construction
  of my artwork so that they last for many years to come.
