<p>
  I am a photographer working in the realm of multiple-
  exposure and impressionistic effects. My artwork has been exhibited
  in over twenty-five art galleries throughout the country.
  These include Eastman Kodak Company, Paychex, Linden Oaks Surgery
  Center, Frontier, Eastman Savings & Loans, the Rochester Lilac
  Festival, and more.

  I believe photography is the single key to memorizing a moment, which
  can save a business in the realm of success.
