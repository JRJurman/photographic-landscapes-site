Without understanding your client, you will never understand what form your product
needs to take. Forge had requested a label which displayed the powerful, yet

the final label has carried their sauce to over one-dozen local Rochester vendors.
These include Leo's Bakery, Skips Meat Market, Herrema's Grocery (shown) and Hart's
Local Grocers (shown).
